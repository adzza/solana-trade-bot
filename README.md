   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

4. Restart your terminal or run:
   ```bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

7. Manually create a `.env` file and configure it.

---

## üìù Setting Up the `.env` File

To configure the bot, you need a **Solana Tracker Data API Key**, an **RPC Endpoint URL**, and a **WebSocket URL** for real-time data streaming.

### Step 1: Get a Free Solana Tracker Data API Key

1. Visit the [Solana Tracker API Documentation](https://docs.solanatracker.io/public-data-api/docs).
2. Sign up for an account if you don‚Äôt already have one.
3. After signing in, navigate to the **API Key Management** section.
4. Generate a new API key (free tier is available for basic usage).
5. Copy the generated API key.

### Step 2: Get a Solana RPC Endpoint URL

#### Option 1: Use a Free Public RPC
Use the default Solana mainnet RPC:
```
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```
Note: Public RPCs are rate-limited and may not be suitable for high-frequency trading.

#### Option 2: Use a Premium/Private RPC
For better reliability and higher rate limits, consider using premium providers like:
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/solana-tracker)
- [Helius](https://dev.helius.xyz)

### Step 3: Get Your WebSocket URL

1. Upgrade your Solana Tracker plan to Premium or higher to access WebSocket streaming.
2. Navigate to the WebSocket section in your Solana Tracker dashboard.
3. Copy your unique WebSocket URL (e.g., `wss://websocket.solanatracker.io`).

##   Available Rooms for Subscriptions

latest	Updates about new tokens and pools
price:poolId	Price updates for a specific pool
transaction:tokenAddress	Transactions for a specific token
wallet:walletAddress	


### Step 4: Add Configuration to `.env`

Add your API key, RPC URL, and WebSocket URL to your `.env` file:
```plaintext
# Solana Tracker API Key (replace with your actual key)
API_KEY=your_solana_tracker_api_key_here

# Solana RPC Endpoint URL (replace with your actual endpoint)
RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# WebSocket Configuration (replace with your WebSocket URL)
WS_URL=wss://websocket.solanatracker.io
```
