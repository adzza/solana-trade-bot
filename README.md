   ```

4. Restart your terminal or run:
   ```bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm

   nvm use --lts
   ```

7. Manually create a `.env` file and configure it.

---

## üìù Setting Up the `.env` File

To configure the bot, you need a **Solana Tracker Data API Key** and an **RPC Endpoint URL**. Follow these steps to obtain them and set up your `.env` file:

### Step 1: Get a Free Solana Tracker Data API Key

1. Visit the [Solana Tracker API Documentation](https://docs.solanatracker.io/public-data-api/docs).
2. Sign up for an account if you don‚Äôt already have one.
3. After signing in, navigate to the **API Key Management** section.
4. Generate a new API key (free tier is available for basic usage).
5. Copy the generated API key.

### Step 2: Get a Solana RPC Endpoint URL

#### Option 1: Use a Free Public RPC
Use the default Solana mainnet RPC:
```plaintext
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```
Note: Public RPCs are rate-limited and may not be suitable for high-frequency trading.

#### Option 2: Use a Premium/Private RPC
For better reliability and higher rate limits, consider using premium providers like:
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/solana-tracker)
- [Helius](https://dev.helius.xyz)

### Step 3: Create and Configure Your `.env` File

1. Create a new `.env` file in your project directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

3. Add the following content to your `.env` file:
```plaintext
# Bot Configuration
AMOUNT=0.001
DELAY=1000
MONITOR_INTERVAL=3000
SLIPPAGE=25
PRIORITY_FEE=0.00005
JITO=false

# Solana Tracker API Key (replace with your actual key)
API_KEY=your_solana_tracker_api_key_here

# Solana RPC Endpoint URL (replace with your actual endpoint)
RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# WebSocket Configuration (replace with your WebSocket URL)
WS_URL=wss://websocket-url-here

# Wallet Configuration (replace with your wallet's private key in Base58 format)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key_here

# Token Filtering Parameters
MIN_LIQUIDITY=1000
MAX_LIQUIDITY=1000000
MIN_MARKET_CAP=2000
MAX_MARKET_CAP=10000000
MIN_RISK_SCORE=0
MAX_RISK_SCORE=8
REQUIRE_SOCIAL_DATA=false

# PnL Thresholds for Selling Positions
MAX_NEGATIVE_PNL=-50
MAX_POSITIVE_PNL=5

# Markets to Trade On (Comma-Separated)
MARKETS=raydium,orca,pumpfun,moonshot,raydium-cpmm
```

4. Replace placeholders (`your_solana_tracker_api_key_here`, `your_base58_private_key_here`, etc.) with your actual values.

5. Save and exit (`CTRL+O`, then `Enter`, followed by `CTRL+X` in nano).
