---

## 📝 Setting Up the `.env` File

To configure the bot, you need a **Solana Tracker Data API Key**, an **RPC Endpoint URL**, and a **WebSocket URL** for real-time data streaming.

### Step 1: Get a Free Solana Tracker Data API Key

1. Visit the [Solana Tracker API Documentation](https://docs.solanatracker.io/public-data-api/docs).
2. Sign up for an account if you don’t already have one.
3. After signing in, navigate to the **API Key Management** section.
4. Generate a new API key (free tier is available for basic usage).
5. Copy the generated API key.

### Step 2: Get a Solana RPC Endpoint URL

#### Option 1: Use a Free Public RPC
Use the default Solana mainnet RPC:
```
https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```
Note: Public RPCs are rate-limited and may not be suitable for high-frequency trading.

#### Option 2: Use a Premium/Private RPC
For better reliability and higher rate limits, consider using premium providers like:
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/solana-tracker)
- [Helius](https://dev.helius.xyz)

### Step 3: Get Your WebSocket URL

1. Upgrade your Solana Tracker plan to Premium or higher to access WebSocket streaming.
2. Navigate to the WebSocket section in your Solana Tracker dashboard.
3. Copy your unique WebSocket URL (e.g., `wss://websocket.solanatracker.io`).

### Step 4: Add Configuration to `.env`

Add your API key, RPC URL, and WebSocket URL to your `.env` file:
```plaintext
# Solana Tracker API Key (replace with your actual key)
API_KEY=your_solana_tracker_api_key_here

# Solana RPC Endpoint URL (replace with your actual endpoint)
RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# WebSocket Configuration (replace with your WebSocket URL)
WS_URL=wss://websocket.solanatracker.io
```

## 🌐 Configuring WebSocket Streams

The WebSocket API allows you to stream real-time data such as price updates, transactions, and token information.

### Example Code for Connecting to the WebSocket

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
require('dotenv').config();

const wsUrl = process.env.WS_URL;

if (!wsUrl) {
  console.error("WebSocket URL is not defined in .env file");
  process.exit(1);
}

const socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);

socket.on('open', () => {
  console.log('Connected to Solana Tracker WebSocket');
  
  // Example: Subscribe to price updates for a specific pool ID
  const poolId = 'examplePoolId';
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'join', room: `price:${poolId}` }));
});

socket.on('message', (data) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(data);
  console.log('Received message:', message);
});

socket.on('close', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from Solana Tracker WebSocket');
});

socket.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
});
```
